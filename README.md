# Hi, Iâ€™m David ðŸ‘‹

I'm an Android Engineer blending technical expertise and a drive for positive impact.
With 3+ years of hands-on Android development using modern Kotlin, Jetpack (including Compose), and clean architecture (MVVM), I design robust, user-centric mobile applications that serve real needs. 
My foundation includes over 10 years of experience in software engineering (C++ and Java) across high-stakes environments like aeronautics, telecommunications, and public transport.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m deeply committed to building meaningful tech, whether by improving digital sustainability, facilitating climate awareness workshops or designing tools that empower teams.
I thrive in collaborative, mission-driven environments where software meets purpose.

Letâ€™s build things that matter.
